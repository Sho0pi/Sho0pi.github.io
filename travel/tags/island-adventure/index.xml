During that time, I decided to book a flight to this super tiny island called
<strong>Kumejima (久米島町)</strong> - just a 30-minute flight (or a 4-hour boat ride) from
the main island. We only had 30 hours there, but honestly, it was the best
decision we made on this whole trip!</p>

<p>We landed in Kumejima pretty early, around 11AM, and had a few hours to kill
before hotel check-in - and to be honest, we really didn&rsquo;t know what to expect.
We brought our snorkel masks from home and just hoped for the best.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
