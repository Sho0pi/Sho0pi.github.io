During that time, I decided to book a flight to this super tiny island called
Kumejima (久米島町), located just a 30-minute flight - or a 4-hour boat ride
from the main island. We only had 30 hours there, but it was the best decision
we made on this whole trip!</p><figure><img src=plane.jpg loading=lazy><figcaption>"Our tiny 40-seater airplane"</figcaption></figure><p>So we arrived to Kumejima very early in about 11 am and we had some time till
our hotel check-in - we really didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. We brought our
snorkeling masks from home and hope for the best!</p></div><a href=/travel/stories/japan/30-hours-in-kumejima/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/travel/tags/island-adventure/ class="link blue hover-black">Tag: Island Adventure</a></h2><div class="w-100 mb4 nested-copy-line-height relative bg-white"><div class="mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden bg-white"><span class="f6 db">Stories</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/travel/stories/japan/30-hours-in-kumejima/ class="link black dim">30 Hours in Kumejima - the Best Island in Japan</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p>Me and my girlfriend spent about 4 days in Okinawa as a quick getaway trip.
