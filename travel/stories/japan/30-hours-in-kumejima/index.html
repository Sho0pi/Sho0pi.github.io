During that time, I decided to book a flight to this super tiny island called
Kumejima (久米島町), located just a 30-minute flight - or a 4-hour boat ride
from the main island. We only had 30 hours there, but it was the best decision
we made on this whole trip!

So we arrived to Kumejima very early in about 11 am and we had some time till
our hotel check-in - we really didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. We brought our
snorkeling masks from home and hope for the best!'><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.147.9"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/travel/ananke/css/main.min.8d048772ae72ab11245a0e296d1f2a36d3e3dd376c6c867394d6cc659c68fc37.css><link rel=canonical href=https://sho0pi.github.io/travel/stories/japan/30-hours-in-kumejima/><meta property="og:url" content="https://sho0pi.github.io/travel/stories/japan/30-hours-in-kumejima/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="My travel blog"><meta property="og:title" content="30 Hours in Kumejima - the Best Island in Japan"><meta property="og:description" content='Me and my girlfriend spent about 4 days in Okinawa as a quick getaway trip.
