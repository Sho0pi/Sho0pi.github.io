During that time, I decided to book a flight to this super tiny island called
&lt;strong>Kumejima (久米島町)&lt;/strong> - just a 30-minute flight (or a 4-hour boat ride) from
the main island. We only had 30 hours there, but honestly, it was the best
decision we made on this whole trip!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We landed in Kumejima pretty early, around 11AM, and had a few hours to kill
before hotel check-in - and to be honest, we really didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to expect.
We brought our snorkel masks from home and just hoped for the best.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
